# Virtual Fitting room

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

A virtual fitting room app that creates a 3D avatar from a user’s body measurements, allowing them to see how items would look and fit before purchase. It enhances the shopping experience, increases buyer confidence, and reduces retailer returns. 


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? This idea solves two major problems. For customers, shopping online often leads to uncertainty about fit and appearance, causing frustration, wasted time, and unsatisfying purchases. For retailers, high return rates due to size and fit issues increase costs, hurt margins, and reduce customer loyalty. This app addresses both by giving shoppers confidence in sizing and style while helping retailers cut return costs and increase sales.

How common or frequent is this problem? This problem is very common and widespread in the fashion industry. For customers, studies show that over 70% of online shoppers hesitate to buy clothes because they are unsure about sizing and fit. Many either avoid purchasing or “bracket” (buy multiple sizes to return later). For retailers, apparel e-commerce return rates are among the highest of all categories, typically 30–40%, and over 80% of those returns are due to size/fit issues. Returns cost retailers billions annually in logistics, restocking, and lost sales. In 2024, global e-commerce returns exceeded $800 billion USD, with fashion accounting for the largest share.

What is your personal motivation? I want to have my own business in something I like and believe is useful, especially since my wife is a fashionista. 

Why is this topic important or interesting? This topic is important because it sits at the intersection of technology, fashion, and consumer behavior. Online fashion is one of the fastest-growing retail segments but suffers from high return rates, making fit uncertainty a major challenge with massive untapped value. Returns are not only costly but also harmful to the environment, as many items end up in landfills or require additional shipping that increases carbon emissions. At the same time, shoppers crave both convenience and confidence, and a solution that helps them see how clothes will fit makes the online experience more enjoyable and trustworthy. By leveraging AI and 3D technology, virtual fitting rooms and personalized avatars have the potential to redefine the way people shop for fashion online.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account? Users begin by entering their body measurements—such as height, weight, and key dimensions like chest, waist, and hips—into the app. The platform then generates a personalized 3D avatar that accurately reflects their body shape. Shoppers can browse clothing items from participating retailers and virtually “try on” different styles and sizes to see how they would look and fit. This solution is most useful in online shopping environments where customers cannot physically test garments before buying, saving time and reducing uncertainty. Primary users include online shoppers seeking better fit accuracy, as well as retailers aiming to reduce return rates and improve customer satisfaction. The design should prioritize ease of use, data privacy, realistic visualization, and inclusivity for diverse body types.

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else? The data comes from a mix of user inputs and external datasets. Users start by entering their own body measurements—such as height, weight, chest, waist, and hips—when creating their 3D avatar. For more accurate results, the app can also allow optional body scans or full-body photos using a smartphone camera. This personal data is collected directly and securely, used only to generate the avatar and fit visualization.

To train and improve the AI model, the system would also rely on publicly available body-shape datasets (like CAESAR) and clothing size data from partner retailers. These datasets provide a wide range of body proportions and garment dimensions that help the AI learn how different fabrics and sizes fit various body types. All data is anonymized and handled in compliance with privacy standards to ensure users’ information remains safe and confidential.

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this? While the virtual fitting room can greatly improve sizing accuracy and reduce returns, it doesn’t completely eliminate all fit and style issues. Factors like fabric texture, stretch, comfort, and personal preference are still difficult to simulate perfectly. Lighting, posture, and how people perceive themselves in clothing can also affect how realistic the virtual try-on feels.

From a technical side, creating accurate 3D avatars depends on the quality of the measurements or scans users provide—small errors can lead to less precise results. The system also relies on retailers to share accurate garment dimensions, which may vary between brands.

Ethically, the main considerations involve data privacy, body image, and inclusivity. The app must ensure that users’ body data and images are securely stored, never shared without consent, and handled under strict privacy regulations (like GDPR). It’s also important to design the system to represent diverse body types and avoid promoting unrealistic beauty standards. Finally, transparency about how the AI model uses personal data and how fit predictions are made will be key to earning users’ trust.

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? This project could grow from a simple fitting app into a complete AI-driven fashion platform. In the future, it could recommend clothing styles that match a user’s body shape, personal taste, and past purchases. It could also integrate with retailer websites, allowing users to virtually try on outfits directly while shopping online. With enough data and development, the system could evolve into a tool that supports sustainability, helping brands reduce overproduction and customers make smarter, longer-lasting choices.

To move forward, the project would need a mix of technical, design, and business skills. On the technical side, expertise in AI modeling, computer vision, and 3D rendering would be essential. For design, UX/UI specialists could make the virtual fitting experience smooth and realistic. Collaboration with fashion retailers, data privacy experts, and investors would also help bring the solution to market. Finally, marketing and business development support would be key to building partnerships and scaling the platform globally.
